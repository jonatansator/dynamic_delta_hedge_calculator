# dynamic_delta_hedge_calculator

- This project calculates and manages dynamic delta hedging for short call options, using key metrics like Delta, time to maturity, and hedging costs.
- It enables users to maintain a delta-neutral portfolio by adjusting share ownership weekly, based on the Black-Scholes model and stock price movements, as outlined in John C. Hull’s “Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives.”
